"""Check the built site for links that go nowhere.

    python3 pipeline/check_site.py [dist]

HANDOFF §4: find something the output can be checked against, and check it every
build. `pipeline/verify.py` does that for the data; this does it for the pages.

Carried unchanged from NFL Analysis, where its first run found 544 dead links
because two components were building a URL by hand instead of going through the
one helper. Expect the same the first time this project has more than one page
type.

Only internal links are followed. External ones are somebody else's uptime.
